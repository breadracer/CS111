File description:
main.c: Source code of the entire lab
Makefile: Contains targets all, check, dist, and clean
README: This text file

Known limitations:
This is the submission for lab1 part B which implements most of the
funcionalities, but --profile is still not enabled. Also, the structure
of the code can be further improved by seperating the code into different
c files.
